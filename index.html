                    However, except for those common factors shared by international students from all over the world, Chinese students are specifically affected by unique Asian cultures and values.

                <div class="tipbox" style="display: inline; margin: 0% 0 80% 0" >
                    For example, many collectivistic Asian cultures emphasize hard work and academic achievement, not only as a personal accomplishment, but also as a family honor. 
                    <div style="margin: 1em 0 0 0">
                        The traditional Confucian values also de-emphasize individual desires, and instead promote the fulfillment of family duties and expectations as a demonstration of maturity and filial piety. 
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="tipbox" style="display: inline; margin: 0% 0 80% 0" >
                    Since many Chinese international students are funded by their families, they have to strive for perfectionto meet their parents' wishes and justify the family’s financial sacrifice.
                </div>

                <div class="tipbox" style="display: inline; margin: 0% 0 80% 0" >
                    Therefore, Asian international students often experience higher pressure in their academic careers. 
                    <div style="margin: 1em 0 0 0">
                        When they met difficulties in their academic performance or not passed exams, it is hard to accept the result different from their self-expectations. Shame, guilt, and worries arise quickly, and this "failure" can be hard to bear.
                    </div>
                </div>

                
                <div class="tipbox" style="display: inline; margin: 0% 0 80% 0" >
                    Another significant cultural factor is the <span class="highlight">saving face</span> concern. Some Asian cultures believe that the symptoms of mental illness result from weaknesses in personality, and seeking counseling means exposing personal weaknesses (losing face) to others and bringing shame to the family.
                </div>

                <div class="tipbox" style="display: inline; margin: 0% 0 80% 0" >
                    Therefore, a large majority of these students from collectivistic culture would avoid seeking help from family or acknowledging problems so as not to cause disappointment or shame. 
                    <div style="margin: 1em 0 0 0">
                        Instead, they may choose to keep problems to themselves and internalize their stress, contributing to depression, social anxiety, hopelessness, and suicidality.

                    Additionally, the common <span class="highlight">social stigma</span> of mental illness also greatly hinders international students from seeking counseling services.
                    <div style="margin: 1em 0 0 0">
                        Many Asian cultures have equated mental disorders with severe illnesses, such as schizophrenia. Seeing a psychiatrist may mean admitting to a diagnosis of a severe psychiatric problem, and having a relative with a psychiatric diagnosis has been shown to have negative implications for potential marriages in China.

                <div class="tipbox" style="display: inline; margin: 0% 0 80% 0" >
                    Given this, many international students are concerned about whether the information they share in counseling will be put on their records or affect their immigration statuses. This <span class="highlight">confidentiality issue</span> also becomes a significant barrier for these students to seek professional help.

                <div class="tipbox" style="display: inline; margin: 0% 0 80% 0">
                    The <span class="highlight">linguistic barrier</span> still makes it challenging for Chinese international students to utilize mental health services properly. Many Chinese international students choose not to call on- or off-campus offices out of the second language anxiety, including those that can offer resources for addressing mental health issues.

                    Resarchers have found that self-stigma greatly suppressed Chinese international students’ mental health help-seeking intentions, while face concerns resulted in increasing mental health problems.

                    It is also found that student's perceived English proficiency had a significant influence on help-seeking intentions. When they are not confident in their English proficiency, they are less likely to seek help.

                        The low intention to seek help due to stigma resulting from face concerns may cause more incompetence in their academic progress and thus loses more face. Seeking help rather makes them feel incompetent, especially when they have self-stigma.

But the funny thing is, because I was dealing with harassment from my neighbor, the school gave me a special fast-track option. Whenever I needed it, I could see a counselor right away.

        <div style="margin: 1em 0 0 0; font-weight: 300; line-height: 1.5; font-style: italic;">
            I told them that I wanted a counselor who’s a minority woman, and they found me a Latina female therapist. She’s actually quite nice, but I always feel exhausted after talking to her because she really doesn’t understand East Asians. For instance, one time, I had just finished my classes and then went for a job interview.

        <div style="margin: 1em 0 0 0; font-weight: 300; line-height: 1.5; font-style: italic;">
            Afterward, I told her how tired I was. She said, “Why do you want this job? What attracts you to this company?” After I finished explaining, I felt completely drained. It was partly because of speaking in English and partly because her questions felt like another round of interviews, which was exhausting. So, I haven’t seen her again, but the doctor who prescribed medication for me is a very kind Taiwanese woman. She’s been a great help, and I’m truly grateful.

            Now I believe that when it comes to work, you can go to a place where there are no Chinese people, and you can live in a place without any Chinese people. However, when it comes to counseling, you absolutely must find someone who speaks your language."
